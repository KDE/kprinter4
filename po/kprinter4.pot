" <qt>  <b>Print Poster</b> (enabled or disabled).  <p>If you enable this "
"option, you can print posters of different sizes  The printout will happen "
"in the form <em>'tiles'</em> printed on smaller  paper sizes, which you can "
"stitch together later. <em>If you enable this  option here, the <em>'Poster "
"Printing' filter</em> will be auto-loaded in  the 'Filters' tab of this "
"dialog. </p> <p>This tab is only visible if the external <em>'poster'</em> "
"utility is  discovered by KDEPrint on your system. [<em>'poster'</em> is a "
"commandline  utility that enables you to convert PostScript files into tiled "
"printouts  which allow for oversized appearance of the stitched-together "
"tiles.] </p> <p><b>Note:</b> The standard version of 'poster' will not work. "
"Your system  must use a patched version of 'poster'. Ask your operating "
"system vendor to  provide a patched version of 'poster' if he does not "
